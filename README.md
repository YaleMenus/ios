This app was created to replace the official Yale Dining app on Android, which was unpleasant to use due to outdated graphics, usability issues, and several recurring bugs. It provided a cleaner and better-designed interface to Yale Dining data, including new features such as the ability to set a dining hall as an auto-opening favorite, marking menu items as favorites to be notified when they're served, and setting up visual warnings when a recipe violates your dietary restrictions.

During Summer 2020, Yale Dining removed the iOS and Android versions of their dining apps, and replaced their API with a human-facing website. [YaleDine](https://yaledine.com) was created to develop a scraping-based solution to replace the official API with a new one that was better designed. Subsequently, this app was rebuilt to rely on the new YaleDine API. At the same time, the Android app Yale Dining Plus was rebranded to [Yale Menus](https://github.com/YaleMenus/android) to serve as the Android version of this app.
